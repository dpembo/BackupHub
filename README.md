#BackupHub
BackupHub is a lightweight yet powerful solution for managing and scheduling shell-based executions across a local area network. Designed for IT administrators, it ensures secure, encrypted communication between a central hub and remotely managed agents. BackupHub streamlines job execution, scheduling, monitoring, and notifications, making it an effective tool for backup and automation tasks.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v20+)
- Docker (recommended for BackupHub server deployment)
- Linux environment for agents

### Docker Setup (Recommended)
1. Pull the latest BackupHub image:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/dpembo/backuphub/hub:latest
   ```
2. Run the container with the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name BackupHub -e TZ=Europe/London -p 8082:8082 -p 49981:49981 --restart unless-stopped -v /custom/BackupHub/data:/usr/src/app/data -v /custom/BackupHub/scripts:/usr/src/app/scripts -v /custom/BackupHub/logs:/usr/src/app/logs ghcr.io/dpembo/backuphub/hub:latest
   ```
3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8082`.

### Manual Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dpembo/BackupHub.git
   cd BackupHub
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the hub:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8082`.

## Usage
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Open the web interface at `http://localhost:8082`.
   - Register a new user with a username, email, and password.
   - Log in to access the dashboard.
2. **Agent Setup**:
   - Navigate to the "Agents" screen in the web interface.
   - Click the (+) button to generate agent installation commands.
   - Copy and run the commands on the target machine, configuring the agent with a unique name, WebSocket settings, and start method (e.g., PM2, cron, or Docker).
   - For more information see the quick start guide  [here](https://github.com/dpembo/BackupHub/blob/main/docs/installation.md)
3. **Managing Jobs**:
   - Use the inline script editor to create or edit scripts.
   - Pressing the templates icon in the editor will give you a quick start.  There's a simple test job named ```Test-5-Seconds.sh``` which should be great to test the setup.
   - Other templates are available for jobs regarding proxmox, rsync, mysql/mariadb, and more
   - Schedule jobs via the dashboard (daily, weekly, or custom).
   - Monitor job status and logs in real-time.
